    <p>A system-independent forth written in C.</p>
<h3 id="notable-features">Notable Features</h3>
<h4 id="build-process">Build Process</h4>
<p>Building stac involves 2 phases of compilation, one phase that generates the constants for a particular system,
which are then included in the main compilation phase, compiling the actual binary.  This keeps everything
static in the binary, precluding the necesity of config files and their interpreters, although it does mean that
the binary can&rsquo;t simply be copied from system to system, although in practice, due to the similarities in platforms,
it should work fine within Linux machines.</p>
<h4 id="type-safety">Type Safety</h4>
<p>Although at first glance the code does not seem to put an emphasis on type safety, the program never uses a void pointer
nor any other circumventions of the type system.  All type-casts are well formed and deterministic, although we do cast
pointers a lot.</p>
<h4 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>
<p>The code was written to model that of a VM as closely as possible, with an array of integers representing a disk, and a
series of registers implemented.  For convenience those registers are implemented inside the disk array, allowing stac code
to manipulate them directly.</p>
<h4 id="power">Power</h4>
<p>As a forth, it attempts to stay true to form as possible to the original system implemented by Chuck Moore.  It has no types,
and no checks.  It&rsquo;s effectively scalpel that can let you cut through things very fast, but at the same time can cut your head off.
It&rsquo;s meant to be a programming system more than a language, which means that a lot of things are not implemented, but shouldn&rsquo;t be too
difficult to implement should the need arise.  It is a framework for developing ideas, rather than a proscribed set of injunctions on
your thoughts.</p>
