      <h1>About Dallin</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Dallin started teaching himself how to program in C++ at 12 years old, driven
by his fascination with the inner workings of the computer.  He then proceded
to learn everything he could about different ways of programmming: extensively
investigating the Lisp and Forth families of languages, reading about Smalltalk
and Haskell.  He began to be curious about more than just application
programming and began investigating different operating systems: the Lisp
machine OS Genera, Chuck Moore&rsquo;s Forth system, and Plan9 from Bell Labs, among others.
These, in turn, informed his later projects and learning, encouraging him to pick
up Clojure, write his own Forth system, and learn the Go language.  He also
aquired a strong theoretical background, reading articles on lambda
calculus, finite-state automata, coroutines, and
others.</p>
<p>At the age of 18 he left home to serve as a missionary for the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Lima, Peru.  There he had the
opportunity to do web-scraping and database manipulation in Go, to
expedite the processes of immigration, and design the UI for a system managing
the progress of all the missionaries.  Now he lives in Provo, UT, and is as
avid as ever about continuing his learning and putting it into practice.  He
currently works with Arduino and is teaching himself microservice development
with Go.</p>
